## Global Medieval and Early Modern Digital Library: Guide for Contributors

The Global Medieval and Early Modern Digital Library provides a platform for publishing original translations of primary sources that have not been previously translated into English, covering a broad range of regions, languages, traditions, and genres from the period between 500 and 1700. A core part of our mission is a deep commitment to interdisciplinarity and intellectual exchange among scholars working across different languages and cultures of the medieval and early modern periods, as well as the promotion of our field and making it more accessible to non-specialists. We hope that this open access resource will help the users to discover the hitherto unnoticed connections between diverse civilizations and religions and to appreciate the global aspects of these formative periods in world history.

We encourage submissions from specialists and beginning scholars alike. In order to assure the accuracy and quality of the translations, we request that all undergraduate and graduate student translators have the approval form (available on the website) signed by a faculty specialist before submitting their translation to the GMEM Digital Library. If you are unable to find a specialist to provide this approval, let us know and we will assist in doing so. Correctly formatted (see below) and faculty-approved translations should be sent as Word documents to upenngmrs@sas.upenn.edu.
