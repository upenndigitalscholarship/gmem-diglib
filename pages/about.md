## About the Global Medieval and Early Modern Digital Library

The Global Medieval and Early Modern Digital Library provides a platform for publishing original translations of primary sources that have not been previously translated into English, covering a broad range of regions, languages, traditions, and genres from the period between 500 and 1700. A core part of our mission is a deep commitment to interdisciplinarity and intellectual exchange among scholars working across different languages and cultures of the medieval and early modern periods, as well as the promotion of our field and making it more accessible to non-specialists. We hope that this open access resource will help the users to discover the hitherto unnoticed connections between diverse civilizations and religions and to appreciate the global aspects of these formative periods in world history.
