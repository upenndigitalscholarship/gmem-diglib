                <p>The GMEMS site was built by Cynthia Heider (Public Digital Scholarship Librarian) and [Cassandra Hradil (Digital Humanities Specialist)](https://www.library.upenn.edu/staff/cassandra-hradil), staff associated with Penn Libraries' [Research Data and Digital Scholarship team](https://www.library.upenn.edu/rdds).</p>
                <p>All of the site's documentation, files, and codebase can be found in its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/upenndigitalscholarship/gmems-diglib).</p>
                <p>This site is generated using [CollectionBuilder-Sheets](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-sheets), an experimental template that directly parses CSVs to create small digital collection exhibits on GitHub Pages designed for teaching digital library skills. Using CB-Sheets, it is possible to use a Google Sheets spreadsheet for your collection metadata, allowing you to see the outcome of metadata edits update immediately.</p>
